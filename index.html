                        </p>
                            
                        <p>It is published under the MF Bunko J imprint with ten novels released between April 25, 2012, and January 25,
                        2018. The author and his wife, Mashiro Hiiragi, adapted the novels into a manga series for Monthly Comic Alive in
                        2013. Later that year, an anime adaptation of No Game No Life by Madhouse was announced. It premiered on AT-X between
                        April and July 2014, and was simulcast outside Japan by Crunchyroll. An anime film adaptation of the sixth volume,
                        No Game, No Life Zero, premiered on July 15, 2017. A spinoff manga, No Game No Life, Please!, focusing on the character
                        Izuna, ran from May 27, 2015, to November 27, 2017. The No Game No Life franchise was localized in North America by 
                        several companies: Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the manga, Sentai Filmworks the anime, and Yen Press the light 
                        novel series.
                        </p>

                        <p>The series follows Sora and his younger stepsister Shiro, two hikikomori who make up the identity of Blank, 
                        an undefeated group of gamers. One day, they are challenged by the god of games to chess and are victorious. 
                        As a result, the god summons them to Disboard, a world where stealing, war, and killing are forbidden, and all 
                        matters are decided through games, including national borders and even people's lives. Intent on maintaining their 
                        reputation as the undefeated gamers, Sora and Shiro plan to conquer the sixteen ruling species and to usurp the god 
                        of games.
                        </p>

                        <p>The series began receiving recognition in 2014, when it appeared in Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! and had its 
                        volumes placed as one of the top thirty selling novels in Japan. It was reported in May 2017 that over 3 million 
                        printed copies are in circulation. The English localization of the manga and anime were also well received: the 
                        manga adaptation appeared on The New York Times Manga Best Sellers; meanwhile, English reviewers were generally 
                        turned away by the first episode of the anime, though reviewers who have completed the series generally praised 
                        the character dynamics, game strategies, and animation, while disliking the fan service featuring the underage Shiro.

                        a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Negi Haruba. It was serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine 
                        from August 2017 to February 2020. The series follows the daily life of a high school student Futaro Uesugi, who is hired 
                        as a private tutor for a group of identical quintuplets: Ichika, Nino, Miku, Yotsuba, and Itsuki Nakano. At the very beginning 
                        of the story, it is shown that the events are being told in a flashback, while an adult Futaro prepares to marry one of the Nakano 
                        Quintuplets whose identity is only revealed near the end of the series.
                        </p>

                        <p>The series is published in English by Kodansha USA under the Kodansha Comics imprint. The anime series is licensed in North 
                        America under a Crunchyroll-Funimation partnership. An anime television series adaptation produced by Tezuka Productions aired 
                        from January to March 2019 on TBS and other channels. A second season produced by Bibury Animation Studios aired from January

                        </p>
                    
                        <p>The series is a commercial success, being the 5th best-selling manga in 2019, and the 3rd best-selling manga in the first half 
                        of 2020 in Japan. In 2019, the manga won the award for the shōnen category at the 43rd annual Kodansha Manga Awards.</p>
                    
                        <p>High school student Futaro Uesugi is an academically gifted student that leads a difficult life—his mother has died, he has 
                        no friends, and on top of all that, his father has incurred a large amount of debt.
                        </p>

                        <p>An opportunity presents itself when the rich Nakano family transfers to his school. Futaro is promptly hired as a highly paid 
                        tutor. However, much to Futaro's dismay, he discovers that his five charges—identical quintuplet sisters of varied personalities—have 
                        no interest in studying at all and have abysmal grades. Some of the quintuplets are against having Futaro, whom they view as a stranger, 
                        in their apartment, but Futaro's diligent tenacity gradually convinces those girls to accept him and to improve their grades.
                        </p>

                        <p>Throughout the series, Futaro develops special relationships with each of the quintuplets. Through a flashforward, it is revealed that 
                        he eventually marries one of them, but her true identity is only revealed near the end of the series.

                        <p>Due to the incident that occurred in VR MMORPG Sword Art Online—where 10,000 players were trapped in the game on launch day—the 
                        popularity of VR games has plummeted due to fear of similar incidents. The NerveGear, SAO's VR device, was recalled and destroyed, 
                        but with the launch of its successor, the AmuSphere, combined with release of the license-free development support package the "Seed", 
                        the popularity of VR games saw a sudden resurgence.

                        <p>The story follows Karen Kohiruimaki, a university student with a complex about her abnormal height. She begins playing a VR game

                        <p>The series is set mainly at Totsuki Saryo Culinary Institute, an elite culinary school located in Tokyo, Japan, which only 
                        a handful of students graduate from each year.[b] Its students mostly come from Totsuki's junior high school, but transfers 
                        are taken provided they pass the entrance exam. The campus is a wide-ranging resort with many research societies (clubs), 
                        cooking classrooms, and large arenas used for competitions. Housing varies, but the most affordable is the Polaris Dormitory, 
                        where characters have to impress the dorm matron with a dish in order to secure residence. Totsuki also runs a chain of resort 
                        hotels, with the biggest being the Totsuki resort run by Gin Dojima, which is visited during Soma's first year at Totsuki.

                        <p>The top student chefs occupy seats on the Council of Ten Masters, the highest governing body in the school aside from the 
                        school director. Students can initiate a shokugeki (anime: food war), a cooking fight with stipulations on the line, with any 
                        other student or alumnus. Battles fought in this way could be for cooking utensils, research society facilities, council membership, 
                        or even expulsion from the school.

                        <h2>Darling in the Franxx</h2>

                        <p>Darling in the Franxx (Japanese: ダーリン・イン・ザ・フランキス, Hepburn: Dārin In Za Furankisu), abbreviated as DarliFra 
                        (ダリフラ, DariFura),is a 2018 Japanese science fiction romance anime television series co-produced by A-1 Pictures and 
                        Trigger and animated by Trigger and CloverWorks that premiered in January 2018. The series was announced at Trigger's 
                        Anime Expo 2017 panel in July 2017. A manga adaptation by Kentaro Yabuki and another four-panel comic strip manga began 
                        serialization in January 2018.
                        </p>

                        <p>Darling in the Franxx is set in a dystopian future where children are artificially created and indoctrinated solely 
                        to defend the remnants of civilization. The story follows a squad of ten pilots, particularly focusing on the partnership 
                        between Hiro, a former prodigy, and Zero Two, a hybrid human and elite pilot who aspires to become entirely human.
                        </p>

                        <p>The animation began international distribution simultaneously upon its domestic release. The streaming service Crunchyroll 
                        internationally simulcast the series, with Aniplus Asia simulcasting the series in Southeast Asia. Service partner Funimation 
                        began the dubbed release of the series in February 2018.
                        </p>

                        <p>Darling in the Franxx takes place in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future where the remnants of human civilization have abandoned 
                        the surface. Adults and children exist in contrasting environments from each other. Adults live in technologically advanced cities 
                        within Plantations and are immortal, but procreation and relationships among them have become obsolete and undesirable. Artificially-created 
                        children, termed "parasites", are deprived of individuality and are educated only for piloting Franxx in pairs to defend humanity. The children 
                        are kept in isolation from adult society in environments nicknamed "birdcages", which emulate that of a bygone era so that they can develop the 
                        emotional responses required to pilot Franxx.
                        </p>

                        <p>In the early 21st century, the progress of human civilization was accelerated by ground-breaking discoveries in mining technology, allowing 
                        the extraction of magma energy for a new low-cost, all-encompassing energy source. Scientists contributing to the breakthrough form "APE", 
                        an organization that would significantly influence world politics and the global economy as a result of their discoveries. After discovering 
                        human immortality, much of mankind opted to become immortal despite the side effect of losing their reproductive functions. A cult of 
                        personality surrounds Papa, the chairman of the APE, which all humans come to worship akin to a god. Now governing the remnants of civilization, 
                        APE leads humanity to abandon Earth's now desolate surface for the relative safety of mobile fortress-cities known as Plantations.

                        <h2>Angel Beats !</h2>

                        <p>Angel Beats! is a 13-episode Japanese anime television series produced by P.A.Works and Aniplex and directed by Seiji Kishi. The story was 
                        originally conceived by Jun Maeda, who also wrote the screenplay and composed the music with the group Anant-Garde Eyes, with original character 
                        design by Na-Ga; both Maeda and Na-Ga are from the visual novel brand Key, who produced such titles as Kanon, Air, and Clannad. The anime aired 
                        in Japan between April 3 and June 26, 2010 on CBC. An original video animation (OVA) episode was released in December 2010, and a second OVA was 
                        released in June 2015. The story takes place in the afterlife and focuses on Otonashi, a boy who lost his memories of his life after dying. He is 
                        enrolled into the afterlife school and meets a girl named Yuri who invites him to join the Afterlife Battlefront, an organization she leads which 
                        fights against the student council president Kanade Tachibana, a girl also known as Angel with supernatural powers.
                        </p>

                        <p>Angel Beats! is set in the environment of a high school in the afterlife, a type of limbo for people who have experienced trauma or hardships 
                        in life and must overcome them before passing on and being reincarnated. The story follows Yuzuru Otonashi, a boy with amnesia who ends up in the 
                        afterlife. He meets Yuri Nakamura, a girl who invites him to join the Afterlife Battlefront (死んだ世界戦線, Shinda Sekai Sensen), or SSS, an 
                        organization she founded and leads which rebels against an unseen God for their unfair circumstances in life. Their enemy is Angel, the student 
                        council president, who has supernatural powers and is believed to be God's associate. After joining the SSS, Otonashi meets other members, 
                        including Hideki Hinata, the co-founder; Masami Iwasawa, the lead vocalist of a four-girl rock band, Girls Dead Monster (GDM); and Yui, an 
                        underclassman and fan of GDM. Other than the SSS members, the afterlife is populated by fabricated students and teachers, whom Yuri refers to 
                        as "non-player characters" (NPCs).
                        </p>

                        <p>Otonashi participates in several SSS operations and missions, despite still questioning the morality of their actions. During one of GDM's 
                        diversion concerts, Iwasawa passes on from the afterlife after achieving satisfaction through her music. After the SSS manages to demote 
                        Angel from her position, Otonashi partially regains his memories with the aid of deputy president Ayato Naoi's hypnosis. He later befriends 
                        Angel, whose real name is Kanade Tachibana, and remembers the rest of his past while in her presence. Otonashi helps her make peace with the 
                        SSS and learns of the afterlife's true purpose. He subsequently offers to aid Kanade in helping other SSS members to pass on, and Kanade is 
                        reinstated as student council president in accordance with their plan. They are joined by Hinata and Naoi, with the former helping Yui move 
                        on by fulfilling her desire of marriage.
                        </p>

                        <p>Mysterious shadow-like entities begin appearing, attacking the residents of the afterlife by turning them into NPCs. Otonashi reasons with 
                        the other SSS members and many of them agree to pass on in lieu of becoming an NPC. Yuri destroys the source of the shadows, which were created 
                        by computers programmed to activate when love was detected in the afterlife to prevent it from becoming a paradise. Her affections for the 
                        members of the SSS allow her to finally overcome her regret, and by this time, the only other ones who have not passed on are Otonashi, Kanade, 
                        Hinata and Naoi. The five remaining students hold a graduation ceremony before Naoi, Yuri and Hinata pass on leaving only Otonashi and Kanade.
                        </p>

                        <p>Otonashi confesses to Kanade that he has fallen in love with her and wants them to remain in the afterlife to help others move on. However,
                        Kanade reveals that her regret was being unable to thank her heart's donor, Otonashi, for extending her life. Otonashi is heartbroken after she 
                        thanks him and passes on, leaving him alone in the afterlife. Later, two people resembling Otonashi and Kanade encounter each other on the 
                        street in the real world. In an alternate epilogue, Otonashi becomes the high school's student council president and helps lost souls depart 
                        from the afterlife while waiting to see Kanade again.
