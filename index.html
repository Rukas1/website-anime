                        series by Yū Kamiya. The series follows a group of human gamers seeking to beat the god of games at a series
                        of boardgames in order to usurp the god's throne.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>It is published under the MF Bunko J imprint with ten novels released between April 25, 2012, and January 25,
                        2018. The author and his wife, Mashiro Hiiragi, adapted the novels into a manga series for Monthly Comic Alive in
                        2013. Later that year, an anime adaptation of No Game No Life by Madhouse was announced. It premiered on AT-X between
                        April and July 2014, and was simulcast outside Japan by Crunchyroll. An anime film adaptation of the sixth volume,
                        No Game, No Life Zero, premiered on July 15, 2017. A spinoff manga, No Game No Life, Please!, focusing on the character
                        Izuna, ran from May 27, 2015, to November 27, 2017. The No Game No Life franchise was localized in North America by 
                        several companies: Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the manga, Sentai Filmworks the anime, and Yen Press the light 
                        novel series.
                        </p>

                        <p>The series follows Sora and his younger stepsister Shiro, two hikikomori who make up the identity of Blank, 
                        an undefeated group of gamers. One day, they are challenged by the god of games to chess and are victorious. 
                        As a result, the god summons them to Disboard, a world where stealing, war, and killing are forbidden, and all 
                        matters are decided through games, including national borders and even people's lives. Intent on maintaining their 
                        reputation as the undefeated gamers, Sora and Shiro plan to conquer the sixteen ruling species and to usurp the god 
                        of games.
                        </p>

                        <p>The series began receiving recognition in 2014, when it appeared in Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! and had its 
                        volumes placed as one of the top thirty selling novels in Japan. It was reported in May 2017 that over 3 million 
                        printed copies are in circulation. The English localization of the manga and anime were also well received: the 
                        manga adaptation appeared on The New York Times Manga Best Sellers; meanwhile, English reviewers were generally 
                        turned away by the first episode of the anime, though reviewers who have completed the series generally praised 
                        the character dynamics, game strategies, and animation, while disliking the fan service featuring the underage Shiro.

                        <p>The Quintessential Quintuplets (Japanese: 五等分の花嫁, Hepburn: Go-Tōbun no Hanayome, lit. "Five Equal Bride(s)") is 
                        a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Negi Haruba. It was serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine 
                        from August 2017 to February 2020. The series follows the daily life of a high school student Futaro Uesugi, who is hired 
                        as a private tutor for a group of identical quintuplets: Ichika, Nino, Miku, Yotsuba, and Itsuki Nakano. At the very beginning 
                        of the story, it is shown that the events are being told in a flashback, while an adult Futaro prepares to marry one of the Nakano 
                        Quintuplets whose identity is only revealed near the end of the series.
                        </p>

                        <p>The series is published in English by Kodansha USA under the Kodansha Comics imprint. The anime series is licensed in North 
                        America under a Crunchyroll-Funimation partnership. An anime television series adaptation produced by Tezuka Productions aired 
                        from January to March 2019 on TBS and other channels. A second season produced by Bibury Animation Studios aired from January 
                        to March 2021. The second season's sequel will be released as a film in May 2022.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>The series is a commercial success, being the 5th best-selling manga in 2019, and the 3rd best-selling manga in the first half 
                        of 2020 in Japan. In 2019, the manga won the award for the shōnen category at the 43rd annual Kodansha Manga Awards.</p>
                    
                        <p>High school student Futaro Uesugi is an academically gifted student that leads a difficult life—his mother has died, he has 
                        no friends, and on top of all that, his father has incurred a large amount of debt.
                        </p>

                        <p>An opportunity presents itself when the rich Nakano family transfers to his school. Futaro is promptly hired as a highly paid 
                        tutor. However, much to Futaro's dismay, he discovers that his five charges—identical quintuplet sisters of varied personalities—have 
                        no interest in studying at all and have abysmal grades. Some of the quintuplets are against having Futaro, whom they view as a stranger, 
                        in their apartment, but Futaro's diligent tenacity gradually convinces those girls to accept him and to improve their grades.
                        </p>

                        <p>Throughout the series, Futaro develops special relationships with each of the quintuplets. Through a flashforward, it is revealed that 
                        he eventually marries one of them, but her true identity is only revealed near the end of the series.

                        <p>Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online (Japanese: ソードアート・オンライン オルタナティブ ガンゲイル・オンライン, 
                        Hepburn: Sōdo Āto Onrain Orutanatibu Gangeiru Onrain) is a Japanese light novel series written by Keiichi Sigsawa and 
                        illustrated by Kouhaku Kuroboshi. The series is a spin-off of Reki Kawahara's Sword Art Online series. A manga adaptation

                        <p>Due to the incident that occurred in VR MMORPG Sword Art Online—where 10,000 players were trapped in the game on launch day—the 
                        popularity of VR games has plummeted due to fear of similar incidents. The NerveGear, SAO's VR device, was recalled and destroyed, 
                        but with the launch of its successor, the AmuSphere, combined with release of the license-free development support package the "Seed", 
                        the popularity of VR games saw a sudden resurgence.
                        </p>

                        <p>The story follows Karen Kohiruimaki, a university student with a complex about her abnormal height. She begins playing a VR game 
                        called Gun Gale Online after it gives her the short, cute avatar that she has always wanted.
